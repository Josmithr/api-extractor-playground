# Re-exporting of module "namespaces" across package boundaries yields malformed type roll-ups.

This repo contains 2 packages, `package-a` and `package-b`.
`package-b` depends on `package-a`, and both are configured with API-Extractor.

In this scenario, `package-a` contains a single root export, which is a "namespace" generated via:

```typescript
import * as A from './NamespaceModule.js';
export { A };
```

It's type rollup, generated by API-Extractor looks like this:

```typescript
declare namespace A {
	export { Foo, bar, Baz };
}
export { A };

/** @public */
declare const bar = 5;

/** @public */
declare interface Baz {
	value: string;
}

/** @public */
declare class Foo {}

export {};
```

`package-b` also contains a single root export, which is simply a re-export of namespace `A` from `package-a`.
It is also configured with `package-a` specified in its `bundledPackages`.
Its export looks like this:

```typescript
export { A } from 'package-a';
```

I would expect `package-b`'s type roll-up to look identical to that of `package-a`, but instead, a malformed rollup is generated:

```typescript
export declare namespace A {
	{
		Foo, bar, Baz;
	}
}

export {};
```

Notice that the necessary imports are missing for `Foo`, `bar`, and `Baz`.
