# Issue repro

`package-a` contains two exported classes: `Foo` and `Bar`.
The 2 classes are identical.

`Foo` is exposed via `export`, while `Bar` is exposed via `export type`.

While the 2 classes are functionally identical, how each is exposed to the end-user is very different: `Foo` may be referenced and instantiated, while `Bar` may only be referenced.
Changing how either `Foo` or `Bar` are exposed has implications for the end-user, and further, changing `Foo` to be a type-only export would be a breaking change.

But these differences cannot be discovered via the API reports generated by API-Extractor.
The entries for `Foo` and `Bar end up being identical.
E.g.,

```typescript
export class Bar {
	constructor(value: number);
	readonly value: number;
}

export class Foo {
	constructor(value: number);
	readonly value: number;
}
```

The above are accurate depictions of the type information, but do not sufficiently reflect the usage implications of standard vs type-only exports.

It would be useful to preserve the type-only nature of type-only exports, so that these implications are clear in the reports, and so related API changes are detectable through report changes.
Something like the following would be ideal:

```typescript
declare class Bar {
	constructor(value: number);
	readonly value: number;
}
export type Bar;

export class Foo {
	constructor(value: number);
	readonly value: number;
}
```
